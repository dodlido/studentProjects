# The Design and Implementation of a Binary Classification Accelerator for Edge Devices 

## Introduction

Image processing has become an essential component of various biomedical techniques used for detecting and diagnosing medical disease, however, traditional algorithms’ complexity and computational demands pose significant challenges, particularly in environments with limited hardware resources. At this point, the concept of lightweight binary classification algorithms comes into play, addressing the need for efficient yet effective processing capabilities. These algorithms can provide high accuracy while minimizing computational overhead and resource consumption, making them ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments. 

## Project Description

Students will study different lightweight solutions of binary classification algorithms (K-NN, CNN and decision trees). Out of the above techniques, the students will choose one architecture and implement a hardware accelerator designed for low-power, on-chip, inference of input images.   
Students will learn how to provide standardized interfaces (from the AMBA family) to provide the user with a way to configure, manage and operate the block.   
Students will create specifications of their block, familiarizing themselves with industry standards and comparing between alternative solutions.

## Project Goals 

1. Architecture Basics \- Students will weigh different designs’ pros and cons, acquiring tools on how to manage real-world tradeoff problems.   
2. Industry Standard Interfaces and Design Practices \- Students will familiarize themselves with common interfaces of the AMBA family as well as Learn about ‘good-practice’ design principles.  
3. Machine Learning Basics \- Students will meet basic ML classification algorithms.   
4. Low Power \- Students will learn how to optimize their designs for low power edge devices.   
5. Documentation \- Students will learn how to compare between alternative solutions and create an architecture level specification of a block.
